A PyTorch implementation of **Quantized Gradient Descent (QGD)** — a communication-efficient distributed optimizer that exploits stochastic quantization to escape saddle points in nonconvex optimization. Published in *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences* (PNAS), 2024.

## Why QGD Matters
Distributed training is the backbone of modern ML infrastructure — but some problems keep showing up in production:

| Production Pain Point | How QGD Solves It |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Communication bottleneck** — gradient/parameter exchange dominates wall-clock time in multi-GPU and cross-datacenter training (the #1 scaling blocker at Google, Meta, Microsoft) | QGD compresses all inter-node communication via stochastic quantization — adjustable from 32-bit down to just a few bits per parameter, with **provable convergence guarantees** |
| **Saddle points in nonconvex landscapes** — large models (LLMs, diffusion, recommender systems) have optimization landscapes riddled with saddle points that degrade model quality | Most approaches inject artificial noise (extra compute + tuning). QGD gets saddle-point escape **for free** from the quantization noise that's already there for compression |
| **Edge / federated deployment** — surveillance cameras, autonomous vehicles, IoT sensors can't centralize raw data due to bandwidth and privacy | Agents exchange only quantized model parameters; raw data never leaves the device |
| **No extra hyperparameters** — perturbed GD methods add noise scales, schedules, and warm-up stages to tune | QGD's perturbation comes from quantization itself — the only new knob is quantization level, which directly maps to your bandwidth budget |

**Key insight**: Quantization noise — traditionally treated as a nuisance to suppress — is actually *exactly the right kind of perturbation* to escape saddle points. QGD is the first method to prove this and exploit it.

## Highlights

- **Saddle-point avoidance via quantization**: Switching even/odd quantization grids ensures persistent perturbation in every direction — provably escaping all strict saddle points
- **Communication efficiency**: Up to 10× compression of inter-node communication with no accuracy loss
- **Convergence to second-order stationary points**: The first distributed quantized method with this guarantee
- **Drop-in PyTorch optimizer**: Implemented as a `torch.optim.Optimizer` subclass — swap it into any distributed training pipeline

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/YananBo/qgd-distributed-optimizer.git
cd qgd-distributed-optimizer

# Install
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run a quick demo — watch QGD escape a saddle point (~30 seconds)
cd experiments/binary_classification
python binary_classification.py --method qgd --iterations 5000

# Compare against vanilla DGD (gets stuck at the saddle point)
python binary_classification.py --method dgd --iterations 5000
```
